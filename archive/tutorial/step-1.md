# 1 . Create accounts, add API maps to BitScoop, and set up authorization
You will need to obtain developer accounts and/or API keys for each of the services listed below that you wish to use. Steam does not have a developer account, but

For each API, you will add an API Map to your BitScoop account using the “Add to BitScoop” buttons. You can either enter any required API keys and User information when you create the map or edit the source of that map later.

You need to create a BitScoop account via (https://bitscoop.com/signup) as well as an AWS account.
For the sake of brevity we will not cover the specifics here. Learn BitScoop (especially connections) and AWS. 

## Add API Maps to BitScoop

To quickly get started with what you'll need on BitScoop, you can add the following API Maps using the buttons below.
Make sure to substitute the values for the API keys, client IDs, and client secrets where appropriate.

| API Map   | File Name       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

# GitHub
On our [GitHub page](https://github.com/bitscooplabs/bitscoop-social-app-demo/tree/master/fixtures/maps), click the ‘Add to BitScoop’ button next to the map for GitHub. You will be redirected to BitScoop. (Make sure you are logged in on BitScoop.) You will see the JSON for the map you just added. You do not need to add any information to this map. Click the ‘+ Create’ button in the upper right-hand corner to save the map.

Create an account with GitHub if you don’t have one already.
When you’re signed in, go to [your developer settings page](https://github.com/settings/developers).
Click on Register a New Application.
Enter a name and homepage URL, and copy the Callback URL from the API Map you made into ‘Authorization callback URL’.
Click Register Application.
You should be taken to the settings for the application you just made.
Go back to the details for the API Map and click ‘Source’ in the upper right to edit the Map.
Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the GitHub application into ‘auth_key’ and ‘auth_secret’, respectively, in the ‘auth’ portion of the Map, then save the Map.

Repeat the above steps starting with registering a new application to make a separate application and Map for GitHub Login.
GitHub does not allow for multiple callback URLs on the same application, so for simplicity we're using one Map for Login and another Map for retrieving data.

# Google
On our [GitHub page](https://github.com/bitscooplabs/bitscoop-social-app-demo/tree/master/fixtures/maps), click the ‘Add to BitScoop’ button next to the Map for Google. You will be redirected to BitScoop. (Make sure you are logged in to BitScoop.) You will see the JSON for the map you just added. We don’t have an auth_key or auth_secret yet, so leave those fields as is. Then click the ‘+ Create’ button in the upper right-hand corner to save the map.

Create an account with Google if you don't have one already.
Go to the Google API Console for [People](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/people.googleapis.com/overview), [Drive](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/overview) and [Gmail](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com/overview) and make sure all are enabled.
Next click on ‘Credentials’ on the left-hand side, underneath ‘Dashboard’ and ‘Library’. Click on the blue button ‘Create Credentials’ and select ‘OAuth client id’.
Choose application type ‘Web application’, then in ‘Authorized redirect URIs’ enter the Callback URL that can be found on the Details page for the API Map you created for Google Analytics; it should be in the form https://auth.api.bitscoop.com/done/<map_id>.
Click ‘Create’ twice; it should show a pop-up with your client ID and secret. These will be entered in the API Map as the auth_key and auth_secret, respectively, in the ‘auth’ portion of the map.

Create another Map for Google Login.
Unlike GitHub and Twitter, Google allows for multiple callback URLs for the same set of credentials, so all we have to do is enter the Login Map's Callback URL alongside the main Map's Callback URL.
