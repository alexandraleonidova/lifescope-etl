# OLD LifeScope APP Project

You can build with any API on the BitScoop platform which makes being a software developer more interesting than ever.
In our “Built with BitScoop” series, we show very specific use cases for the BitScoop platform to give you ideas and foundations for new projects.

Today we're demonstrating a real-world app that collects a user's information from various social networks once a day and stores it all in a single searchable format.

*Built with BitScoop*
